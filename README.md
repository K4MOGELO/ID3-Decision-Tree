## Introduction

Welcome to the "ID3 Algorithm - Decision Tree" project repository. This project focuses on implementing the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm to construct a decision tree, which is a powerful tool for predictive modeling and classification. The primary application for this project is the prediction of student performance based on various factors such as study hours, attendance, and previous grades.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment associated with this project is to develop a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm. The assignment guidelines are as follows:

- The implementation of the Decision tree should be in a programming language of your choice.
- You have the freedom to choose the dataset for your implementation.
- You can refer to Section 10.3 of the textbook for guidance on implementing a decision tree. Additionally, you can follow the example demonstrated in class to print the decision tree.

All the best in completing your assignment!
